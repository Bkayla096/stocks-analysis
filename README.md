# stocks-analysis


## Overview of Project
This project is meant to refactor the original code from module. The current code uses stock data from 2017 and 2018 but is adaptable. It will be suitable to run the analysis on future stock data.



## Results
The resulting code has nearly halved the speed of running of the analysis. It also has made the code more user friendly. The refactoring has consolidated and lessened the memory load of the program. 



## Summary 

Refactoring allows for a much faster proccess and a more adaptable program. It also shows how there is more then one way to write code and that looking at it again can always shed light on a more efficient way to achieve the same goal.
